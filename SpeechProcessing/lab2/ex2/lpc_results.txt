a) Changing the analysis window lenght from 20 ms to 10 ms produces a residual with more signal content than the previous (usually the spikes are taller). o residuo fica mais intelegivel tbm

b) The residue for half the windows interval has higher energy value. The formants are more well defined in the one with bigger window interval (the other is flatter).

c) The one with prediction order of 10 has more well defined formants than the one with 16. Also the intelegibility of the first is better than the latter.
