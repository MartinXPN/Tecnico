# Feedback and Feedforward as a dialogic communication in the learning environment

### a) Feedback definition

Feedback and Feedforward cover a big number of functions in education. While feedback gives information about how the task was done, feedforward aims to provide guidance for the future. There are many approaches on how to give effective and useful feedback. The essay specifically focuses on the feedback and feedforward at both individual and organizational levels.

### b) 7 strategies to give efficient feedback [300 characters minimum]

As the feedback can be given in very different forms, it's important to make it as efficient as possible. Some of the most important things while giving feedback or feedforward according to (Brookhhart S.) and (Hathaway P.) are:

* Timing (when the feedback is given and how often): For some situations, it might be better to wait a bit before giving feedback as sometimes students might realize a better way on their own which can be more beneficial for them. On the other hand, it shouldn't be too late as the students might forget the details of the tasks they were performing.
* Amount (how many points made, how much about each point): Sometimes feedback can be very short and the student might not get the point completely, and sometimes adversely, it can be too long for some points which could be made way more concise. So, it's important to keep the amount of feedback with the right amount.
* Mode (oral, written, visual/demonstration): The format/mode of the feedback is also very important. Especially in the case where the student needs to reflect upon the feedback, it makes sense to give it in a written or visual form. On the other hand, if it's instantaneous feedback, it might be easier to give an oral one.
* Audience (individual, group/class): In some cases when the feedback can be universal, it's easier to give it to a big audience like a group or a class of students so that it's relatable to everyone. Also, sometimes, when other people can benefit from the feedback it might be useful to give feedback to a big audience. Yet, if the feedback contains some sensitive information about the student or it's not that relevant to others, it would be better to tell it to that one student.
* Not to judge but to describe: The feedback is more appreciated when it does not include judgment and non-constructive criticism. Thus, the more there is an emphasis on description rather than judgment, the more appreciated the feedback will be.
* Avoid personal comments and focus on the work itself and the process the students used to do the work: Providing feedback for the work itself can be way more valuable if it includes notes about the process and how it was done.
* Use positive comments that describe what is well done: In a lot of cases, it's more important to emphasize what is done right and good than what is done wrong. Also, for the future, the students will keep in mind that they should keep doing some of the things and those won't get shadowed. 



### c) Comment on the following sentence of the article “good interpersonal communication or failure during the feedback (forward) process might either establish or destroy relations” [300 characters minimum]

Although all those tips for giving effective feedback are very important, it's worth noting that feedback, as it is, is a form of communication between people and the way it's handled can lead to either very positive or negative outcomes. In case a teacher has a good relationship with the student before giving some feedback, it would be accepted and followed way better than when there is no close relationship between the student and the teacher.

Also, it's possible for the relationship to be affected because of the given good or bad feedback. So, it's very important to keep in mind the communication aspect of the feedback.

### d) The author reinforces feedback as a dialogic communication, instead of a one way sided situation and places emphasis in the perception of the feedback of the listener of that feedback. What is your opinion on this? [300 characters minimum]

In many cases, the type and depth of the feedback are not expected by the student and it should be very well communicated between the professor and the student. In my opinion, it can become a big problem if the student expects in-depth feedback but receives only grades (which is very common in Tecnico), but on the other hand, it might be too much pressure to receive big feedback when one only expects to see a shallow answer with a grade.

### e) What is the difference between feedback and feedforward? (feel free to look other sources to clarify this point) [200 characters minimum]

Feedback gives information about how the task was done and usually includes comments on what should be done in another way or some notes on what was done well. On the other hand, feedforward aims to provide guidance for the future. It usually includes comments on what to do next, how to approach a similar task afterward, some tips on what to do in similar situations, etc.

### f) Regarding what the author calls “Analytical descriptive feedback” – which we can simplify to Specific feedback, create 3 examples, different from the ones in the text, that distinguish vague feedback from specific feedback – 1 positive and 2 improvement feedback (for example “Your presentation went really well” versus ”I especially loved the way you resumed the principal ideas at the end of the presentation”) – it can be a table like:

|               | Vague                                                        | Specific                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Positive 1    | Amazing presentation.                                        | The details about the history of the film were presented in a very concise and interesting way. I liked how you showed all the hidden meanings in the movie even though they were not obvious at first. |
| Improvement 1 | You can work on time.                                        | Some parts of the presentation could be covered a bit more concisely. Especially the biographies of the characters took a while, while it would be more engaging to focus on the main plot. |
| Improvement 2 | Overall it was good, but you can work more on the style of the slides. | Some slides in the presentation were not consistent with others. It would be better to make all the slides consistent so that it's easier to follow. Especially the second slide was too different from the third and the fourth one. |



### g) Describe a situation you had with vague, ineffective feedback and how you would handle it differently today [300 characters minimum]

One time I had very vague feedback after a presentation on Information Visualization that stated we should work on the types of data presented. So, we didn't understand it right and changed everything, all the data, but eventually, the only thing the professor was asking is to present it in a table format and indicate the types for each variable. So, it was a misunderstanding because of the feedback being too short. Now, I'd try to ask for more details to make sure everything is clear and there is no misunderstanding for a given task especially after feedback.
